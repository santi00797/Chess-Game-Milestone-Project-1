GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
THIS IS A REGULAR CHASE GAME, WHITES WILL START AND THE PIECES ARE MOVED LIKE IN A REGULAR CHESS BOARD.
THE GAME ENDS WHEN THERE IS A CHECK MATE OR A DRAW. 
ONCE YOU CLICK ON A PIECE, YOU MAY SE THE AVAILABLE SPOTS WHERE YOU CAN MOVE THE PART.


(UPDATE)BUG: FOR SOME REASON THE IMAGES FOR THE REST OF THE PIECES THAT ARE NOT PAWNS HAVE DECIDED TO WORK,
